About Keyspace
**************

Keyspace is a replicated key-value database, a product of Scalien, available at http://scalien.com.

Keyspace is set apart from other key-value database because it uses so-called consistent replication,
which means that all nodes see the database going through the same states. In other words, no
split-brain scenario can occur, where different nodes see different versions of the database.
